Every night after 5pm, you're losing money. Not because you're bad at your job. Because you can't answer the phone. Here's what happens to local businesses every single day. A customer has an emergency. Pipe bursts. AC dies. Tooth aches. They call you at 7pm. Voicemail. They call your competitor. Someone answers. Guess who gets the job? This isn't occasional. A study found 62% of calls to local businesses go unanswered. 62 percent. And 78% of customers hire the first business that responds. Do the math. That's tens of thousands of dollars walking out the door every year. And it's not your fault. You can't be on the phone while you're on a job. You can't answer texts while you're with a patient. You can't hire a full-time receptionist for 35 thousand a year. So the calls go to voicemail. The leads go cold. The money goes to your competitors. And you're stuck wondering why business is slow when the answer is sitting in your missed calls. What if there was a way to answer every call, every text, every inquiry 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? Without hiring anyone. Without being glued to your phone. That's exactly what BookedBot does. BookedBot is your AI-powered receptionist. It answers calls. Qualifies leads. Books appointments directly into your calendar. While you sleep. While you work. While you live your life. Here's how it works. Customer calls after hours.
